Cats Effect specifically, and fibers as an idea, are meant to solve a very particular problem: how do you architect the control flow of a highly-asynchronous, highly-concurrent application without losing your mind or sacrificing performance? That’s the primary thing they are designed to do. This is why their benefits in terms of code quality and maintainability are usually only felt within realistic examples, and not in scenarios which fit into slides or blog posts.

More relevantly to our original point though, this is also why the performance question is less obvious than it initially seems. In “the large” of system design, micro-optimized performance questions such as how fast you can loop over a List are just not relevant. Instead, what’s really relevant is how efficiently you optimize the utilization of system resources such as CPU pipelining and page faults, what your inefficiencies are around contention and scheduling, whether or not you have pathological outcomes under pressure, and so on.

This is where Cats Effect truly shines. By providing a prescriptive (yet pleasant!) framework for defining your application’s control flow, Cats Effect is able to deeply understand what it means to schedule and optimize most programs written in IO, and thus take advantage of this knowledge using algorithms and techniques which would be impossible (or at the very least, highly impractical) in a hand-written application. This is very much like how modern concurrent garbage collectors are usually much faster than hand-tuned malloc/free in practical applications, simply because the GC is able to perform some very complicated and non-local logic which would be essentially impossible if managing memory by hand.
